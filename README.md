bot tweeter that tweet the most populer french song
Created by PAUL HUARD
I recommend you tu use pycharm to test and run the script
To use the bot you need first download the libs:
-tweepy
-googleapiclient
-requests
-emoji

Then, sign up to tweeter and google develloper and create api keys
open the text document called "passwords" and remplace the text *.....* by your key without *

Now it should worked, if you have some errors please refer to the tweepy or google api documentation

To fully automize the script do a FTP on a VPS and make a cron job that run every week the script.
